#|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODOS:

1 Randomly create an initial population of programs from the available primitives. Initial and futures. 
1.1 set data structure for support (attributes member, depth)
repeat
 2 Execute each program and ascertain its fitness. Not compile, compile but result not ok, result ok. Use try catch. Count errors by step lexic, semantic, and so on.
 3 Select one or two program(s) from the population with a probability based on fitness to participate in genetic operations (Section 2.3).
 4 Create new individual program(s) by applying genetic operations with specified probabilities (Section 2.4).
   4.1 Crossover
   4.2 Mutation
until an acceptable solution is found or some other stopping condition is met (e.g., a maximum number of generations is reached).
return the best-so-far individual (may be is necessary transform AST to concrete sintax).
